Project to store solutions to all the problems I have solved in my life as a contestant. This project also stores my personal notebook for competitive programming contests.
Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers.
